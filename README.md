üìå Objective
To build a predictive model that can help financial institutions determine:

Whether a loan should be approved or rejected.

Identify risk factors such as poor credit history, low income, or previous defaults.

‚öôÔ∏è Machine Learning Workflow
Data Preprocessing

Handling categorical variables via label encoding or one-hot encoding

Scaling numerical features (for non-tree models)

Splitting data into train/test sets

Modeling

Primary Model: Random Forest Classifier

Also tested: Logistic Regression, XGBoost (optional)

Evaluation

Accuracy

Precision, Recall, F1-Score

Confusion Matrix

üìÅ Example Usage (Model Training)
python
Copy
Edit
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier

df = pd.read_csv("loan_data.csv")
X = df.drop("loan_status", axis=1)
y = df["loan_status"]

# Encoding categorical columns
X = pd.get_dummies(X)

# Train model
model = RandomForestClassifier()
model.fit(X, y)
üìà Potential Applications
Automated loan screening systems

Credit risk analysis

Financial decision support tools

‚úÖ Requirements
Python 3.x

pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn
